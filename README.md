# AuthoLoad

Autho_load is a first attempt to dry up authorization and resource loading in our controllers. I wanted soemthing straightforward,
with usage similar to Ryan Bate's CanCan,
but using only the loading class' own model as the single authority on access.   

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
